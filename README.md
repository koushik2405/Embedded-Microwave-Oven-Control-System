Embedded Microwave Oven Control System
Using PIC16F877A Microcontroller

.Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an Embedded Microwave Oven Control System using the PIC16F877A microcontroller.
It simulates real microwave oven operations such as mode selection, timer control, keypad input, and LCD display, developed as part of an Embedded Systems Internship.

. Objectives

Understand embedded system architecture

Program PIC microcontroller using Embedded C

Interface matrix keypad and LCD

Implement timer-based control logic

Simulate real-time appliance behavior

. Hardware / Simulation Details

Microcontroller: PIC16F877A

Input: Matrix Keypad

Display: 16×2 Character LCD

Development Environment: MPLAB X IDE

Compiler: XC8

Simulation Tool: PICSimLab

. Software Features

Menu-driven user interface

Keypad-based time and mode selection

LCD status display

Timer interrupt-based countdown

Modular and structured C code

. System Design

The system accepts user input through a keypad, processes it using the PIC16F877A microcontroller, and displays operational status on the LCD.
Timer modules manage cooking duration, and the system stops automatically after completion.
